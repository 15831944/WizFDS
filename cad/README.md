## BricsCAD references
Create a class library using the class library wizard under your preferred .NET language. There are currently two DLLs that must be referenced (BrxMgd.dll and TD_Mgd.dll) plus one optional BREP API DLL (TD_MgdBrep.dll). These DLLs are located in your BricsCAD installation folder.
